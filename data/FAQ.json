Rough estimates indicate approximately a 40% cut in the number of lines of code. \nIt\u2019s also more type-safe, e.g. support for non-nullable types makes applications less prone to NPE\u2019s. \nOther features including smart casting, higher-order functions, extension functions and lambdas with receivers provide \nthe ability to write expressive code as well as facilitating creation of DSL."}, {"type": "h3", "text": "Is Kotlin compatible with the Java programming language?"}, {"type": "p", "text": "Yes. Kotlin is 100% interoperable with the Java programming language and major emphasis has been placed on making sure that your existing codebase \ncan interact properly with Kotlin. You can easily call Kotlin code from Java and Java code from Kotlin. This makes adoption\nmuch easier and lower-risk.
